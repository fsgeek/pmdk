# NAME #

**pmem2_config_get_file_size**() - query a file size

# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmem2.h>

struct pmem2_config;
int pmem2_config_get_file_size(const struct pmem2_config *config, size_t *size);
```

# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmem2_config_get_file_size**() function retrieves the size of the file
in bytes pointed by file descriptor or handle stored in the *config* and puts
it in *\*size*.

This function is a portable replacement for OS-specific APIs.
On Linux, it hides the quirkiness of Device DAX size detection.

# RETURN VALUE #

The **pmem2_config_get_file_size**() function returns 0 on success.
If the function fails, the *\*size* variable is left unmodified, and one of
the following errors is returned:

On all systems:

* **PMEM2\_E\_FILE\_HANDLE\_NOT\_SET** - config doesn't contain the file handle
(see **pmem2_config_set_fd**(3), **pmem2_config_set_handle**(3)).

* **PMEM2\_E\_INVALID\_FILE\_HANDLE** - config contains an invalid file handle.

On Windows:

* **PMEM2\_E\_INVALID\_FILE\_TYPE** - handle points to a resource that is not
a regular file.

On Linux:

* **PMEM2\_E\_INVALID\_FILE\_TYPE** - file descriptor points to a directory,
block device, pipe, or socket.

* **PMEM2\_E\_INVALID\_FILE\_TYPE** - file descriptor points to a character
device other than Device DAX.

* -**errno** set by failing **fstat**(2), while trying to validate the file
descriptor.

* -**errno** set by failing **realpath**(3), while trying to determine whether
fd points to a Device DAX.

* -**errno** set by failing **open**(2), while trying to determine Device DAX's
size.

* -**errno** set by failing **read**(2), while trying to determine Device DAX's
size.

* -**errno** set by failing **strtoull**(3), while trying to determine
Device DAX's size.

On FreeBSD:

* **PMEM2\_E\_INVALID\_FILE\_TYPE** - file descriptor points to a directory,
block device, pipe, socket, or character device.

* -**errno** set by failing **fstat**(2), while trying to validate the file
descriptor.
