# NAME #

**pmem2_config_get_alignment**() - query an alignment

# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmem2.h>

struct pmem2_config;
int pmem2_config_get_alignment(const struct pmem2_config *config, size_t *alignment);
```

# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmem2_config_get_alignment**() function retrieves the alignment of offset and
length needed for **pmem2_map**(3) to succeed. The alignment is stored in
*\*alignment*.

# RETURN VALUE #

The **pmem2_config_get_alignment**() function returns 0 on success.
If the function fails, the *\*alignment* variable is left unmodified, and one of
the following errors is returned:

On all systems:

* **PMEM2\_E\_FILE\_HANDLE\_NOT\_SET** - config doesn't contain the file handle
(see **pmem2_config_set_fd**(3), **pmem2_config_set_handle**(3)).

on Linux and FreeBSD:

* **PMEM2\_E\_INVALID\_FILE\_HANDLE** - config contains an invalid file handle.

on Linux:

* **PMEM2\_E\_INVALID\_FILE\_TYPE** - file descriptor points to a directory,
block device, pipe, or socket.

* **PMEM2\_E\_INVALID\_FILE\_TYPE** - file descriptor points to a character
device other than Device DAX.

* **PMEM2\_E\_INVALID\_ALIGNMENT\_FORMAT** - kernel query for Device DAX alignment
returned data in invalid format.

* -**errno** set by failing **fstat**(2), while trying to validate the file
descriptor.

* -**errno** set by failing **realpath**(3), while trying to determine whether
fd points to a Device DAX.

* -**errno** set by failing **read**(2), while trying to determine Device DAX's
alignment.

* -**errno** set by failing **strtoull**(3), while trying to determine
Device DAX's alignment.

On FreeBSD:

* **PMEM2\_E\_INVALID\_FILE\_TYPE** - file descriptor points to a directory,
block device, pipe, socket, or character device.

* -**errno** set by failing **fstat**(2), while trying to validate the file
descriptor.
