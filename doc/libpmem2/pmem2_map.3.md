# NAME #

**pmem2_map**() - creates a mapping

# SYNOPSIS #

```c
#include <libpmem2.h>

int pmem2_map(const struct pmem2_config *config, struct pmem2_map **map_ptr);
```

# DESCRIPTION #

The **pmem2_map**() function creates a new mapping in the virtual address space
of the calling process. This function requires that following arguments are set
in the *config* object:

* The source of the mapping, which may be either an opened file descriptor or
an opened handle to a file.

    * The file descriptor has to be opened using *O_RDONLY* or *O_RDWR* file
access mode and passed via **pmem2_config_set_fd**(3). Note on Windows the
provided file descriptor is converted to a handle using **\_get_osfhandle**().
For details please see the **open**(3), **pmem2_config_set_fd**(3) and
**\_get_osfhandle**() manual pages.

    * Similarly, the handle has to be created with an access mode of
*GENERIC_READ* or *(GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE)* and passed via
**pmem2_config_set_handle**(3). For details please see the **CreateFile**() and
**pmem2_config_set_handle**(3) manual pages. (Windows only)

    The above functions are mutually exclusive, and only the last source set
prior to **pmem2_map**() is used.

If the **pmem2_map**() function succeeds in creating a new mapping it
instantiates a new *struct pmem2_map** object describing the mapping. The
pointer to this newly created object is stored in the user-provided variable
passed via the *map_ptr* pointer. If the mapping fails the variable pointed by
*map_ptr* will contain a NULL value and appropriate error value will be
returned. For a list of possible return values please see
[RETURN VALUE](#return-value).

All *struct pmem2_map* objects created via the **pmem2_map**() function have to
be destroyed using the **pmem2_unmap**() function. For details please see
**pmem2_unmap**(3) manual page.

# RETURN VALUE #

When **pmem2_map**() succeeds it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns
one of the following error values:

* **PMEM2_E_FILE_HANDLE_NOT_SET** - config doesn't contain a file descriptor or
file handle (Windows)

* **PMEM2_E_INVALID_FILE_HANDLE** - invalid *file descriptor* value in *config*

* **PMEM2_E_MAP_RANGE** - *offset* + *length* is too big to represent it using
*size_t* data type

* **PMEM2_E_MAP_RANGE** - end of the mapping (*offset* + *length*) is outside
of the file. The file is too small.

* **PMEM2_E_MAPPING_EXISTS** - if the object exists before the function call.
For details please see **CreateFileMapping**() manual pages. (Windows only)

It can also return **-EACCES**, **-EAGAIN**, **-EBADF**, **-ENFILE**,
**-ENODEV**, **-ENOMEM**, **-EPERM**, **-ETXTBSY** from the underlying
**mmap**(2) function. It is used with and without **MAP_ANONYMOUS**.

**-EACCES** may be returned only if the file descriptor points to an
append-only file.

It can also return all errors from the underlying
**pmem2_config_get_file_size**() function.
