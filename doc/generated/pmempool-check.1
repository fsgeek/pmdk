\f[B]pmempool\-check\f[R] \- check and repair persistent memory pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ pmempool check [<options>] <file>
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool\f[R] invoked with \f[I]check\f[R] command checks
consistency of a given pool file.
If the pool file is consistent \f[B]pmempool\f[R] exits with 0 value.
If the pool file is not consistent non\-zero error code is returned.
.PP
In case of any errors, the proper message is printed.
The verbosity level may be increased using \f[B]\-v\f[R] option.
The output messages may be also suppressed using \f[B]\-q\f[R] option.
.PP
It is possible to try to fix encountered problems using \f[B]\-r\f[R]
option.
In order to be sure this will not corrupt your data you can either
create backup of the pool file using \f[B]\-b\f[R] option or just print
what would be fixed without modifying original pool using \f[B]\-N\f[R]
option.
.RS
.PP
NOTE: Currently, checking the consistency of a \f[I]pmemobj\f[R] pool is
\f[B]not\f[R] supported.
.RE
.SS Available options:
.PP
\f[C]\-r, \-\-repair\f[R]
.PP
Try to repair a pool file if possible.
