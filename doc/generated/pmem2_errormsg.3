\f[B]pmem2_errormsg\f[]() \- returns last error message
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include\ <libpmem2.h>

const\ char\ *pmem2_errormsg(void);
\f[]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
If an error is detected during the call to a \f[B]libpmem2\f[](7)
function, the application may retrieve an error message describing the
reason of the failure from \f[B]pmem2_errormsg\f[]().
The error message buffer is thread\-local; errors encountered in one
thread do not affect its value in other threads.
The buffer is never cleared by any library function; its content is
significant only when the return value of the immediately preceding call
to a \f[B]libpmem2\f[](7) function indicated an error.
The application must not modify or free the error message string.
Subsequent calls to other library functions may modify the previous
message.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
The \f[B]pmem2_errormsg\f[]() function returns a pointer to a static
buffer containing the last error message logged for the current thread.
If \f[I]errno\f[] was set, the error message may include a description
of the corresponding error code as returned by \f[B]strerror\f[](3).
