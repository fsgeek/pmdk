.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]pmem_memmove\f[R](), \f[B]pmem_memcpy\f[R]() and
\f[B]pmem_memset\f[R]() functions provide the same memory copying as
their namesakes \f[B]memmove\f[R](3), \f[B]memcpy\f[R](3) and
\f[B]memset\f[R](3), and ensure that the result has been flushed to
persistence before returning (unless \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NOFLUSH\f[R] flag
was used).
.PP
For example, the following code is functionally equivalent to
\f[B]pmem_memmove\f[R]() (with flags equal to 0):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
    memmove(dest, src, len);
    pmem_persist(dest, len);
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Calling \f[B]pmem_memmove\f[R]() may out\-perform the above code,
because \f[B]libpmem\f[R](7) implementation may take advantage of the
fact that \f[I]pmemdest\f[R] is persistent memory and use instructions
such as \f[I]non\-temporal\f[R] stores to avoid the need to flush
processor caches.
.RS
.PP
WARNING: Using these functions where \f[B]pmem_is_pmem\f[R](3) returns
false may not do anything useful.
Use libc functions in that case.
.RE
.PP
Unlike libc implementation, \f[B]libpmem\f[R] functions guarantee that
if destination buffer address and length are 8 byte aligned then all
stores will be performed using at least 8 byte store instructions.
This means that a series of 8 byte stores followed by
\f[B]pmem_persist\f[R](3) can be safely replaced by a single call to one
of the above functions.
.PP
The \f[I]flags\f[R] argument of all of the above functions has the same
meaning.
It can be 0 or a bitwise OR of one or more of the following flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN\f[R] \- modifies the behavior to skip the final
\f[B]pmem_drain\f[R]() step.
This allows applications to optimize cases where several ranges are
being copied to persistent memory, followed by a single call to
\f[B]pmem_drain\f[R]().
The following example illustrates how this flag might be used to avoid
multiple calls to \f[B]pmem_drain\f[R]() when copying several ranges of
memory to pmem:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
/* ... write several ranges to pmem ... */
pmem_memcpy(pmemdest1, src1, len1, PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN);
pmem_memcpy(pmemdest2, src2, len2, PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN);

/* ... */

/* wait for any pmem stores to drain from HW buffers */
pmem_drain();
\f[R]
.fi
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NOFLUSH\f[R] \- Don\[cq]t flush anything.
This implies \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN\f[R].
Using this flag only makes sense when it\[cq]s followed by any function
that flushes data.
.PP
The remaining flags say \f[I]how\f[R] the operation should be done, and
are merely hints.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NONTEMPORAL\f[R] \- Use non\-temporal instructions.
This flag is mutually exclusive with \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_TEMPORAL\f[R].
On x86_64 this flag is mutually exclusive with
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NOFLUSH\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_TEMPORAL\f[R] \- Use temporal instructions.
This flag is mutually exclusive with \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NONTEMPORAL\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_WC\f[R] \- Use write combining mode.
This flag is mutually exclusive with \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_WB\f[R].
On x86_64 this is an alias for \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NONTEMPORAL\f[R].
On x86_64 this flag is mutually exclusive with
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NOFLUSH\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_WB\f[R] \- Use write back mode.
This flag is mutually exclusive with \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_WC\f[R].
On x86_64 this is an alias for \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_TEMPORAL\f[R].
.PP
Using an invalid combination of flags has undefined behavior.
.PP
Without any of the above flags \f[B]libpmem\f[R] will try to guess the
best strategy based on size.
See \f[B]PMEM_MOVNT_THRESHOLD\f[R] description in \f[B]libpmem\f[R](7)
for details.

\f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]pmem_memcpy_nodrain\f[R]() is an alias for \f[B]pmem_memcpy\f[R]()

\f[B]pmem_memset_nodrain\f[R]() is an alias for \f[B]pmem_memset\f[R]()
with flags equal to \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN\f[R].
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
All of the above functions return address of the destination buffer.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
After calling any of the functions with \f[B]PMEM_F_MEM_NODRAIN\f[R]
flag you should not expect memory to be visible to other threads before
calling \f[B]pmem_drain\f[R](3) or any of the \f[I]_persist\f[R]
functions.
This is because on x86_64 those functions may use non\-temporal store
instructions, which are weakly ordered.
See \[lq]Intel 64 and IA\-32 Architectures Software Developer\[cq]s
Manual\[rq], Volume 1, \[lq]Caching of Temporal vs.\ Non\-Temporal
Data\[rq] section for details.
