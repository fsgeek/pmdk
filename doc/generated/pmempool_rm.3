.SH NAME

\f[B]pmempool_rm\f[R]() \- remove persistent memory pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <libpmempool.h>

int pmempool_rm(const char *path, int flags);
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]pmempool_rm\f[R]() function removes the pool pointed to by
\f[I]path\f[R].
The \f[I]path\f[R] can point to a regular file, device dax or pool set
file.
If \f[I]path\f[R] is a pool set file, \f[B]pmempool_rm\f[R]() will
remove all part files from local replicas using \f[B]unlink\f[R](2), and
all remote replicas using \f[B]rpmem_remove\f[R](3) (see
\f[B]librpmem\f[R](7)), before removing the pool set file itself.
.PP
The \f[I]flags\f[R] argument determines the behavior of
\f[B]pmempool_rm\f[R]().
It is either 0 or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following flags:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_RM_FORCE\f[R] \- Ignore all errors when removing part
files from local or remote replicas.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_RM_POOLSET_LOCAL\f[R] \- Also remove local pool set file.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]PMEMPOOL_RM_POOLSET_REMOTE\f[R] \- Also remove remote pool set
file.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
On success, \f[B]pmempool_rm\f[R]() returns 0.
On error, it returns \-1 and sets \f[I]errno\f[R] accordingly.
